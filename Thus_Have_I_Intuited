Thus Have I Intuited A Devotional Retelling of Siddhartha's Path
Not from the words of those who heard,
But from the trembling insight of one still bound to the path,
From the ache of a heart that suffers and seeks,
From the edge of knowing, where the Buddha once stood—
Though I, unlike him, may not cross.

The Prince and the Prophecy
Prince Siddhartha, anointed not just by men, but by the Gods themselves.
At his birth, the earth trembled. Blossoms opened out of season. The stars wheeled in stillness. Sages read the marks upon his body and fell silent in awe.
"This child is destined for two paths," they said. "To rule the four quarters of the world as a Chakravarti king, or to renounce all and become a Buddha."
King Śuddhodana rose from his throne, voice firm with love and fear.
"I am sorry," he told the sages. "But peace is brought through the sword. My son will conquer."
Thus, a kingdom of illusion was built. No sickness, no age, no death was to touch the prince's eyes. No wandering holy men were allowed inside the city walls. He grew in music and pleasure, in gardens that never wilted.
But on the seventh day of life, Queen Māyā died.
The child would never know her touch beyond memory. And so a silence rooted itself in his heart—a knowing before language, a sorrow before thought.

The Chariot Rides
Years passed. Prince Siddhartha grew in grace and discipline. He married radiant Yashodharā, and they bore a son, Rāhula. The kingdom rejoiced.
But the silence within him deepened.
One day, he slipped beyond the palace walls with Channa, his charioteer. For the first time, he saw:
    • An old man,
    • A sick man,
    • A corpse.
"This happens to all of us?" he asked.
"Even kings," said Channa.
Siddhartha was struck as by a lightning bolt. That night, he lay beside Yashodharā, watching her chest rise and fall.
"Even this," he thought. "Even this will vanish."
She stirred and whispered, "Then love me now. If it ends, let it end having been true."

The Swan That Would Not Eat
Later, he wandered the gardens and saw two swans by the pond. One was dead. The other stood beside it, unmoving.
"They mate for life," said the gardener. "When one dies, the other may refuse to eat. They don't forget."
That night, he stood watching his father.
King Śuddhodana sat stiffly upon his throne, hands clenched around the illusion of control.
And Siddhartha understood:
"He hid the truth to protect me. Not from control—but love."
He bowed inwardly.
"But love cannot guard us from death. It must walk through it."
He then went to his throne room and starred into the room. The self-arising thought came, "if I stay, I will never be able to leave". He then turned away. Yashodhara tried to close her eyes again. 

The Departure
At midnight, he kissed Rāhula's brow, brushed Yashodharā's cheek, and turned away—not in rejection, but in reverence.
He mounted Kanthaka, his white war-horse.
"Take me as far as the world can carry me," he whispered.
And Kanthaka ran. He ran like a storm against illusion. He ran until his heart burst beneath the trees.
Siddhartha wept beside his fallen friend.
"You carried me not away from the world, but toward its truth."
And it is said Kanthaka was reborn in the heavenly realms for that one perfect act. Yashodhara refused to take in part of the princesses duties and slept on the floor until her husband returned.

The Mourning Farmer
Days later, Siddhartha the Bodhisattva came upon a small field. There, an old farmer planted rice with methodical grace.
"Eat, if you aren't too proud to take the food of the dirt," the man said.
They sat together.
"My wife died three seasons ago," said the farmer. "Fever took her. I buried her by the mango tree. The chickens still needed feeding the next morning."
"And your grief?" Siddhartha asked.
"It comes at night. But the weeds still grow by day. That's the mercy of work."
Siddhartha looked at his smooth hands and thought:
"In the palace, we have time for grief. Too much of it. Here, grief must share space with life."

The Forest Dweller
He met a quiet man in ochre, seated beneath a fig tree.
"Why do we suffer? What is its cause? Can it end?" Siddhartha asked.
The man smiled.
"Then you are not far from truth."
Siddhartha misunderstood, thinking a teacher must be near.
But the forest dweller saw this and said nothing. For to correct him would delay the ripening of his own knowing.
"Let him walk into the question," the man thought. "Let him become it."
And so Siddhartha walked on. Still hungry. Still alone.
But not far now from the roots of awakening.

The Final Breath of Devadatta
Devadatta lay in the dust, bones brittle, fever burning through his spine. The ground beneath him felt like the last thing in the world he still belonged to.
He had tried everything—
    • Tried to outshine Siddhartha in austerity.
    • Tried to form his own Sangha.
    • Tried, in madness, to end the Buddha’s life.
The stone hurled from the cliff had missed. The elephant sent to trample him had bowed instead. Even the earth had opened beneath his feet, but not to swallow him—only to hold him long enough for a single breath of clarity.
Now he was dying, alone. The Sangha would not speak his name. His students had left him. His body trembled not from rage, but from something he had forgotten long ago—regret.
And then—a shadow moved across his face. A hand touched his forehead.
It was him.
Not the radiant Buddha in golden silence, but Siddhartha, the cousin he had known in childhood. The one who smiled at sparrows. The one who once shared mango slices beneath the summer trees.
Devadatta’s breath caught.
"You came," he whispered.
The Buddha said nothing. His gaze was steady, not with judgment—but with presence.
Devadatta wept. Not from pain, but from the unbearable gentleness in that gaze.
He had expected annihilation. He had expected coldness. He had expected the void.
But what he found was Siddhartha.
And suddenly he understood:
No-self did not mean emptiness. It meant there was no separation left to cling to. It meant love, without pride. Forgiveness, without name.
And so, in that final breath, Devadatta let go.
Not in fear. Not in defeat. But in release.
And in that letting go—he was free.

The Vigil Beneath the Bodhi Tree
Siddhartha the Bodhisattva sat beneath the Bodhi tree, his body frail from years of austerity, his mind like a still lake. The roots curled around him like arms. Above, the leaves whispered in the windless dark.
He had taken only grass for a seat, and a vow in his heart:
"Though my skin should dry and my bones turn to dust, I will not rise until I see the truth."
When Siddhartha first learned of suffering, a shadow had taken root within him—not an enemy, but a dissociated voice: Māra. The embodiment of temptation, fear, and illusion. A whisperer. A mirror. An old self that had not yet been met.
Māra first came in a peaceful form, cloaked in fragrance and soft light. He offered his daughters, radiant with beauty and comfort.
"Return," Māra said. "Be a king. Be loved. The forest needs no martyrs."
But Siddhartha sat unmoved.
Then Māra's form shifted.
The wrathful face emerged: flames, demons, thunder, the sky torn with fear.
"You will die here," Māra hissed. "Forgotten. Dust."
Then came the sharpest blade—doubt:
"Who are you to end suffering?"
Siddhartha did not answer. He touched the earth.
"This ground knows me."
And the earth trembled in reply.
Māra’s illusions fell away. Siddhartha saw clearly—that Māra was not other, but within. A voice of self-preservation and false promise. Not to be destroyed, but to be integrated.
And in that moment, Siddhartha found the middle path.
Neither indulgence nor denial. Neither war nor worship. Just presence.
And as the morning star rose, he became The Buddha.
The one who sees. The one who knows. The one who walks no longer in illusion, but in truth.
