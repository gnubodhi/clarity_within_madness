Freud describes pleasure complex, not the psyche. The cure is the middle path
Adler describes power complex, not the psyche. The cure is realising equinimity
Jung describes inflation well, but sees more of the psyche. The cure is grounding the image
Erikson describes the development in context with society. Recognising interconnection of all parts is the cure.
Hillman and Mindell connect the fragmented psyche. Integrating disowned parts is the cure to fragmentation.
This was all introspection that gave us these insights.
