I feel conflicted. I take on the role of scapegoat. It always switches. Sometimes its secondary (unconcious), sometimes its primary (concious). Countary to this is the narcisstic shadow of the scapegoat. Switching from primary to secondary countra to the scapegoat. Both intrapersonally and interpersonally.
