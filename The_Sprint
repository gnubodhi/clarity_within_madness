I remember watching a video of Tom Cruise running for the latest Mission Impossible movie. He wasn't just running. He was so far into character that every single facial twictch was completely within character while running with the most fullest capacity for him to run at. He was completely overtaken by this aspect of his inner-world, expressed as the 'runner'.

It was how I ran when I was a child. I lost myself in running. The mental formation was to run. I let go. I believed I could lose. I then started to later go to running classes to improve my technique. I wasn't as good as the others. But then I lost at school as well. I lost my instictive running. That only came out in Rugby. I loved that I could hit someone as hard as I could as long as I agreed that they could hit me as hard as they could. So I hit them hard. My instinct had transmuted.
