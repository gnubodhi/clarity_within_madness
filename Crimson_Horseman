🌘 The Crimson Horseman
Siddhartha left behind his family, his kingdom, his pleasures —
and rode a white horse into the stillness of the forest,
to conquer his mind,
to witness desire, and unbind it.

But in the shadow of this path
rides another.

He rides not into silence,
but out from it.
His horse, once white, now crimson —
stained by years of war, inner and outer.

His sword drags behind him, worn and heavy.
His spear points forward — not for defence, but judgment.
He carries no shield — not out of courage,
but because he’s no longer defending anything.

⚔️ His Goal Is to Conquer Compassion.
Not because compassion is weak.
Not because it failed.
But because it will not stop hurting.

Because compassion has become a wound he cannot close.
Because he has seen what it costs to feel it, again and again.
Because he envies those who can be cruel and sleep.

He rides to the last place it hides —
not to kill it,
but to test if it can still survive him.

🪷 But Here Is the Twist:
As he rides,
as the blood dries,
as the edge dulls—

he finds something strange:

The more he tries to kill compassion,
the more clearly it sees him.

Not as an enemy.
Not even as a fallen one.
But as a brother returning home —
carrying every wound of the world in his own flesh.

🌀 The Final Paradox:
Siddhartha sought to conquer mind —
and found compassion.

The Crimson Rider sought to conquer compassion —
and found mind.

Both leave behind the illusion of the world.
But one walks into stillness,
the other through fire.

And both become free.

The Blood Mist
He rides through a mist of blood —
not just others’ blood, but his own.
The blood of the past. The blood of grief.
The blood of choices made and unmade.

And he breathes it in.

No mask. No refusal.

He rides through the blood-mist of a thousand forgotten battles,
breathing in what others have tried to forget.
He does not wipe it from his skin.
He does not flinch as it enters his lungs.
