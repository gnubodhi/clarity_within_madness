☁️ The Descent

He looks down from the heavens
at the suffering that permeates everything —
every city corner, every child's cry,
every quiet betrayal whispered behind closed doors.

The angels wait for him to turn away —
to stay radiant, removed,
untouched by the blood and ash below.

But he does not speak.

He just falls.

No wings. No halo.
Only silence.
The angels glance at one another,
knowing what it means —
but none dare stop him.

He crashes into the earth with a thud.
No divine landing.
No glory.
Just dirt in his mouth
and pain in his bones.

🚨 The Fallen Messenger

He stands — slowly,
like someone who’s been through this before.

Not reborn.
Not resurrected.
Just here.

He pulls the red bandana from his pocket,
wraps it around his forehead like a crown.
There’s no choir.
Only the distant sound of sirens,
and children learning how to duck bullets before they learn to read.

This is no saviour.

This is the one who chose to fall —
not to fix the world,
but to bleed with it.
