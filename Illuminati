I once was paranoid that a group known as the Illuminati were overly interested in me. But I eventually saw the delusion as the belief that they could exist is the projected aspect of the disowned qualities of myself that I am now projecting my psychological state to influence they way in which I perceive the world. Withdrawing such a projection is a challenge. It involves owning that the Devil is an aspect of human experience too.
Recognising that all people have this level of darkness within them makes me realise how easy it is for people to lose themselves in such projections. But the emotional experience and the psyches way of trying to reconcile what it was intuiting is what led to the belief system. With me, it is the emotional experience of alienation that led to such a fantasy. I wanted to be noticed special. And that's the inflation.
