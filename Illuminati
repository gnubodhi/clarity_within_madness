I once was paranoid that a group known as the Illuminati were overly interested in me. But I eventually saw the delusion as the belief that they could exist is the projected aspect of the disowned qualities of myself that I am now projecting my psychological state to influence they way in which I perceive the world. Withdrawing such a projection is a challenge. It involves owning that the Devil is an aspect of human experience too.
